### Hello!

I'm Toby, and I think using computers should be fun and empowering! I previously founded [Charm](https://changelog.com/podcast/481) and [Musicmobs](https://www.macworld.com/article/172903/musicmobs.html), and was the head of mobile at [TweetDeck](https://www.zdnet.com/article/steve-jobs-attacks-android-mess-small-tablets/) and [Last.fm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNeibgeqQg8). Way back in the day I was a [WebObjects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgOUaSmXfUU) developer at Apple. I also enjoy hobby churn and teaching street cats to be pretty decent roommates.
